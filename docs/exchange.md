# Exchange cursor anchor/active

These commands enable each cursors' position to be changed relative to the associated
selection. The cursor is the "active" position and the other end of a selection is the
"anchor".

- "Exchange active and anchor" (`selection-utilities.exchangeAnchorActive`)
- "Active to end" (`selection-utilities.activeAtEnd`)
- "Active to start" (`selection-utilities.activeAtStart`)
