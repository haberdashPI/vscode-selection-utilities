We need both tree-sitter-api and this extension to be the same kind of extension.

Start by making this extension a desktop extension (just to get things going)
and then start creating a PR to move tree-sitter-api to a web *and* desktop extension
(I pretty sure it needs to be both to be available to both types of extensions)
