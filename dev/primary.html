You can remove the primary selection and you can add new selections relative to this primary selection.</p> <p>The primary selection also changes how selections are canceled and restored from memory: on a restore the primary selection is always the selection closest to the current cursor position. On a cancel, the cursor is placed at the location of the primary selection.</p> <ul> <li>&quot;Move primary selection left&quot; (<code>selection-utilities.movePrimaryLeft</code>): Make the selection to the left (or above) primary.</li> <li>&quot;Move primary selection right&quot; (<code>selection-utilities.movePrimaryRight</code>): Make the selection to the right (or below) primary.</li> <li>&quot;Focus view on primary selection&quot; (<code>selection-utilities.focusPrimarySelection</code>): Change the view of the current editor so that the active position of the primary selection is visible.</li> <li>&quot;Delete primary selection&quot; (<code>selection-utilities.deletePrimary</code>): Delete the primary selection.</li> <li>&quot;Add next match&quot; (<code>selection-utilities.addNext</code>): Add the next text which matches the primary selection</li> <li>&quot;Skip to next match&quot; (<code>selection-utilities.skipNext</code>): Move the primary selection to the next match.</li> <li>&quot;Add previous match&quot; (<code>selection-utilities.addPrev</code>): Add the previous text which matches the primary selection</li> <li>&quot;Skip to previous match&quot; (<code>selection-utilities.skipPrev</code>): Move the primary selection to the previous match.</li> </ul> <a href="https://github.com/haberdashPI/vscode-selection-utilities">View on GitHub</a> </div> </body></html>
